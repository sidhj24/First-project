# First-project - Evaluation of Stackoverflow survey 2021

Trying out how to setup new repository on GitHub and work on it

**Libraries used** -
1. Numpy - for general aritimatic calculations
2. Pandas - for Dataframes
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn - for Visualization creation
4. Collections - for importing defaultdict

**Motivation**

As as aspiring data scientist, i wanted to assess what skillset other developers and coders have across the globe and what they are aspiring to learn further. Leveraging StackOverflow 2021 Survey data we will be able to understand general trends on how developers are skilled today and are focusing on upskilling.

This repository has following files -

1. StackOverflow Survey 2021.ipynb - The Jupyter Notebook file with the Python code built for this analysis 
2. survey_results_public.csv - The Stackoverflow survey 2021 data used for this assessment
3. survey_results_schema.csv - The Data dictionary for the data used for this assessment

**Quick summary**
